The error occurs because the global CSS file specified in your components.json configuration doesn't exist. Let's create the missing file structure:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory packages/ui-lab/src • **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `components` |
| 📄 `index.ts` |
| 📁 `app` |
| 📁 `providers` |
| 📁 `styles` |
| 📁 `lib` |
| 📁 `hooks` |

</details>

---



---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory packages/ui-lab/src/styles • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `globals.css` |

</details>

---

I found the issue! There's a mismatch between your configuration and actual file structure:

1. Your components.json is looking for `src/styles/global.css`
2. But the actual file is `src/styles/globals.css` (with an 's')

Let's update your components.json file to point to the correct filename:

---

```diff
    "tailwind": {
      "config": "tailwind.config.ts",
-     "css": "src/styles/global.css",
+     "css": "src/styles/globals.css",
      "baseColor": "neutral",
      "cssVariables": true,
```

---



---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory packages/ui-lab • **8** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `components.json` |
| 📄 `registry.json` |
| 📁 `src` |
| 📁 `node_modules` |
| 📄 `tailwind.config.js` |
| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📄 `postcss.config.mjs` |
| 📄 `tsconfig.json` |

</details>

---

There's one more issue to fix. Your components.json refers to a `tailwind.config.ts` file, but you actually have `tailwind.config.js` in your project. Let's update that too:

---

```diff
    "tsx": true,
    "tailwind": {
-     "config": "tailwind.config.ts",
+     "config": "tailwind.config.js",
      "css": "src/styles/globals.css",
      "baseColor": "neutral",
```

---



---

Now try running the command again:

```
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/jatin-yadav05/animated-ai-chat"
```

The errors occurred because of two mismatches in your configuration:

1. Your components.json was looking for `src/styles/global.css` but the actual file is `src/styles/globals.css` (with an 's')
2. Your components.json referenced `tailwind.config.ts` but you have `tailwind.config.js`

Both issues have been fixed in your components.json file.
