I see the file structure of your Next.js project. The project contains:

- App directory with core Next.js files (page.tsx, layout.tsx, actions.tsx)
- Components directory with UI elements like auto-resize-text-area.tsx, code-preview.tsx, progressive-blur.tsx, and prompt-editor.tsx
- Lib directory with schema.ts

What would you like me to help you with regarding these files?
