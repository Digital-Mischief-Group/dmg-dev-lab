how do these work?

_**Assistant**_

I'll examine how the `turbo` and `scripts` folders work in your project.

---

Read file: scripts/index.ts

---

Let's check the other scripts files to understand their functionality:

---

Read file: scripts/utils.ts

---

Now let's check the other files to get a more complete picture:

---

Read file: scripts/initialize.ts

---

Read file: scripts/update.ts

---

Now, let's look at the turbo folder structure to understand the generator templates:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory turbo/generators • **3** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `templates` |
| 📄 `config.ts` |
| 📄 `package.json` |

</details>

---

Read file: turbo/generators/config.ts

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory turbo/generators/templates • **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `package.json.hbs` |
| 📄 `tsconfig.json.hbs` |

</details>

---

Read file: turbo/generators/templates/package.json.hbs

---

Read file: turbo/generators/templates/tsconfig.json.hbs

---

Based on the files I've examined, here's how the `scripts` and `turbo` folders work in your project:

## Scripts folder

This is a command-line toolset for managing your monorepo project:

1. **index.ts**: The entry point that defines two main CLI commands:
   - `init`: For initializing a new project
   - `update`: For updating an existing project to a newer version

2. **initialize.ts**: Handles creating a new project by:
   - Cloning a template repo (next-forge)
   - Setting up environment variables
   - Configuring package manager (npm, yarn, bun, pnpm)
   - Installing dependencies
   - Setting up ORM
   - Initializing Git repository

3. **update.ts**: Manages updating an existing project by:
   - Determining version differences
   - Creating temporary directories
   - Fetching updated files from a template repository
   - Applying changes to the current project

4. **utils.ts**: Contains helper functions and constants used across the scripts.

## Turbo folder

This contains generators for Turborepo to create new packages in your monorepo:

1. **generators/config.ts**: Defines a generator called 'init' that creates new packages with:
   - A standardized package.json file
   - A tsconfig.json file with proper monorepo configurations

2. **templates/**: Contains Handlebars templates:
   - package.json.hbs: Template for new package.json files
   - tsconfig.json.hbs: Template for new tsconfig.json files

To use these tools, you can run commands like:
- `node scripts/index.js init` to create a new project
- `node scripts/index.js update` to update an existing project
- Use Turborepo's generator with `turbo gen init` to create new packages in your monorepo
